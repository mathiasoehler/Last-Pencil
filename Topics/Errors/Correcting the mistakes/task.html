<h2>Correcting the mistakes</h2>
<p></p><p>Take a look at the following code. Did we declare all variables correctly, according to Python's syntax? Try to fix all mistakes, so that <code class="java">SyntaxError</code> will not be raised during the initialization of these variables.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> You should change or add only those quotes that enclose the whole string. Do NOT change the quotes within the string, e.g. don't change the quotes of <code class="java">"double quotes"</code>.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
